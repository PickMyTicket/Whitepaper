A channel manager is a technology solution that allows you to manage the state of your application in a distributed way. Channel manager is a widely used solution in hotels, airlines, and other business.
<br/><br/>
Today accommodation providers such as B&Bs, hotels, and motels use the channel manager solutions to dramatically help the way they sell rooms online, via online travel agents or their own direct website and/or booking engine. It’s power lies in automation, two-way integration, and real-time data sharing.
<br/><br/>
The challenges of existing channel manager solutions are:
* Managed in a centralized database by solution providers thereby single point of failure.
* The state of the booking is not always synchronized across the connected sites.
* Every connected site has its own database with its own state.
* No single source of truth for the state of the booking.
* Double bookings are common in the connected sites. 
<br/><br/>  
<b>PickMyTicket development team is building a solution that will help hotels, airlines, and other business to manage their booking state in a distributed way using blockchain technology. PickMyTicket network will be a decentralized network of smart contracts that will be able to manage the state of the booking in a distributed way. The smart contracts will be able to be deployed on the blockchain and will be able to be accessed by the connected sites. We have chosen to use the Solana blockchain as the platform for the PickMyTicket network because Solana is designed to be fast, scalable, and secure.</b>  
<br/><br/>  
PickMyTicket Network’s ideology is the improve the way hotels, airlines, and other business manage their booking state. Our roadmap includes building libraries and tools to enable business accelerate adoption of the PickMyTicket network.
